# Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project is an AI-driven fraud detection system that identifies suspicious transactions using machine learning and anomaly detection techniques. It leverages supervised and unsupervised learning models to enhance security and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains **284,807** transactions with the following attributes:

- **Time**: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1 to V28**: Features obtained from PCA transformation (principal component analysis).
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The target variable (0 = legitimate transaction, 1 = fraudulent transaction).

### Dataset Summary
- **Total Entries**: 284,807
- **Features**: 30 numerical features + target variable
- **Target Variable**: Binary (0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud)

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies fraudulent patterns in financial data.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** API-based fraud detection system.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualization using Tableau/Power BI.
- **Automated Alerts:** Email/SMS notifications for flagged transactions.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Scalable integration with AWS, GCP, or Azure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, SQL
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI
- **Deployment:** Flask, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, GCP, Azure Functions

## 📊 Data Processing
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features for better model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize fraud trends and data distribution.

## 🤖 Model Development
1. Train multiple ML models and evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
2. Optimize performance using hyperparameter tuning.
3. Select the best-performing model for deployment.

## 🚀 Deployment & Automation
1. Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
2. Store transaction data in an SQL database.
3. Integrate cloud-based solutions (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability.

## 📈 Visualization & Monitoring
- Develop an interactive dashboard in Tableau/Power BI.
- Track fraud trends and model performance in real time.
- Set up automated alerts for flagged transactions.
